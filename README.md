# chore
Many hands make light work
Everything is a chore, but project management shouldn't be

Chore is a window into what we are already doing, plus annotation and structure.

Chore is currently envisiond as a single-screen web user interface divided into four quadrants: the flag, the stop, the run, and the kick.

The Chore Graph is a DAG.

Each Chore has:
  - a short description, no more than three words lowercase, and three syllables desirable
  - an ordered list of sub-chores
  - an ordered list of parent chores
  - a status: not yet started, started, complete

 Chores may also have such things as:
  - a detailed description of the chore
  - a targeted start and/or completion date
  - milestones (chores that end in ':')
  - owner (responsible party)
  - tags
  - listeners
  - budgets and anything else
